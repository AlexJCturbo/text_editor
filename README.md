## Project Description

This project is a single-page Text Editor application that runs in the browser and meets the PWA criteria. It features several data persistence techniques that serve as redundancies in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application implements IndexedDB to create and manage the database for the app. It also implements a service worker using Workbox to provide offline access to the app. In addition, cache strategies are in place to give users a great user experience while using Text Editor.
